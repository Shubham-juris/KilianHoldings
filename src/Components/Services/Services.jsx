          A broad category of offenses can be included under fraud. It also
          includes any violation willfully committed with the intent of
          depriving an individual or company/organization of anything of which
          they are the rightful owner. <br />
          <br />
          Theft is a common offense that comes under fraud. The type of theft
          committed and the amount stolen are taken into consideration to judge
          the seriousness of the offense. A theft of value less than CAD 5000 is
          regarded as a non-seriousoffense. A theft of an amount valuing more
          than CAD 5000 is considered a serious crime. If a weapon is involved
          or if there is a threat of violence, these too can come under serious
          offenses.

        'Reckless or irresponsible driving with scant regard to driving rules and disciplined on-road behavior can result in inadmissibility. When the offense is established, it can result in a denial of entry to the country. Dangerous driving also falls in the same category as far as offenses are concerned. A charge of serious driving violation can seriously hamper the ability of the applicant to enter Canada legally. It will apply even if the individual states they do not intend to drive while in Canada.',

          An assault in almost any form can result in an applicant becoming
          inadmissible to Canada. It could be a physical altercation between
          strangers or a fight between people known to each other, resulting in
          injury. Regardless of where the assault has taken place, it can lead
          to inadmissibility to Canada. <br />
          <br />
          In this type of crime, there are aggravating factors such as the use
          of a weapon or the infliction of bodily harm. In such instances, the
          offense would be considered a serious crime.
